                                I was in my first year of college, when I was first introduced to VITeach through a friend. College life was black & white, a routine with not much excitement. I knew I wanted to do something more, something selfless for the people. VITeach sounded like the perfect opportunity. Initially, I was unaware of the vision & mission of the club. But once I got to meet the OB’s and listen to them speak about the impact we can create, I was inspired! In my first year with the club, I was part of the Resource team, where I worked on developing the syllabus for classes 5, 6 & 7. Designing a syllabus is challenging- you have to cater to all kinds of students, including students with learning difficulties like dyslexia and autism. At that point, I did not know much about the academic level of these students, nor about their grasping power. So, I consulted with seniors, and the members of the School Team, to create an effective syllabus. We included relatable examples and fun activities to hold the attention of the kids and make their learning fun.

                            <p>                                
                                But things changed when I became an OB- the pandemic struck. The whole world moved online but our students didn’t even have access to phones! We struggled to plan the syllabus and teaching methods. Finally, we decided on making a structured syllabus, collecting resources like PPTS & worksheets, and even got started on creating a digital library that the students can access.
                                Working in VITeach also taught me new skills- management, leadership, graphic design, and blogging, amongst others. There have been instances where I spent more than 10 hours a day on club work. It was automatic, it never felt like a chore, and it was work I genuinely enjoyed doing. This club gave me the opportunity to make new friends and meet people with so many different skills and interests- all of whom came together to work towards the singular aim of providing quality education to those who need it the most.  
                                Once the situation is back to normal, I hope to have the chance to go and teach the kids in person. To teach them the syllabus I helped develop, and see their reactions- is something I would love to do!
