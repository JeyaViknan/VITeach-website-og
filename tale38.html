                                Where passion meets purpose, great things evolve. That is what characterizes the life of Sirigineedi Raj Abhinay, the erstwhile General Secretary of VITEACH. With commitment, collaboration, and an earnest desire for making a difference, he converted adversity into instructive lessons and moments of value worth recalling.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being the General Secretary, Abhinay's biggest job was keeping everyone in the club internally harmonious. From volunteers to regular members, he made sure that each of them was an integral cog in the collective machine. In contrast to typical leadership positions where assignments are set in stone, responsibilities were dynamically shared by him and the President according to their strengths. This gave them the ability to construct a cooperative yet functional leadership framework.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No leadership path is complete without obstacles. With 200+ clubs in the college, standing out and keeping people interested was always a challenge. He overcame this by being genuine—prioritizing the club's central mission, being honest in communication, and believing that the right people would always be attracted to their vision. Conflict resolution was another area he excelled in, making sure that conflicts within the club were resolved with empathy and understanding.

                                In the midst of logistical struggles, the most rewarding aspect of his time there was seeing the smiles of the children affected by VITEACH efforts. One of the highlights was when he coordinated a session for the kids of female workers on campus. Seeing the joy emanating from those children reminded him that even the smallest acts of compassion can have a powerful impact.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another heartwarming moment was when he connected with a young boy at an event, carrying him on his shoulders all day long. This did much to seal his appreciation of the club's true mission—to bring happiness and chances to those who need it most.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beyond leadership, his time at VITEACH helped him develop skills that continue to shape his professional journey. Managing people, content writing, work allocation, and social media marketing—each of these skills played a significant role in his current career in social media growth and content strategy.

                                For those stepping into leadership roles at VITEACH, He has simple yet powerful advice, value the legacy of the club. It has been thriving for over a decade, and each leader carries the responsibility to uphold and grow its impact. Prioritize teamwork. A close-knit leadership team can make all the difference. Stay adaptable. No two days will be the same, and dynamic problem-solving is key. Trust yourself. Your gut instinct often knows what’s best.

                                Sirigineedi sees a bright future for VITEACH, where each new batch of leaders takes the club to even greater heights. While he has no particular suggestions for improvement, he wholeheartedly believes in the strength of the current and future teams.
 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reflecting on his time, he does wish he had pushed harder to challenge existing norms when he saw deserving candidates being overlooked for leadership roles. However, he takes pride in the changes they implemented, ensuring fairness for future club members.

                            </p>

                                Being part of VITEACH wasn’t just about running events or handling responsibilities—it was about creating lasting impact. Through his leadership, Sirigineedi Raj Abhinay not only helped shape the club but also grew as an individual, learning invaluable life skills along the way. His journey is a testament to the fact that true leadership isn’t about authority—it’s about connection, empathy, and the willingness to create positive change.

                                I have always wanted to explore all the clubs and chapters in VIT, and right there I came across VITeach. I was moved by the origins of this decade-old club and its rich heritage. As I was going through the pictures, I found memories of my younger self tutoring the kids around my home. Wholeheartedly I applied to join VITeach and got in as a Content Member under Jafrin.

                                I still remember my very first task! It was Stationary Drive 1.0. I spent 3-4 hours every day at the event collecting stationery and doing marketing. Meantime I became close with the OBs and other volunteers and felt like they were my kind of people and more, my family. I used to spend a lot of time on the content team and soon got promoted to Content JCC along with Dhruv and Abhinay, and our Lead Jafrin. She was like a mother to us. I might sound dramatic but if you ask Dhruv or Abhinay, they’ll say the same. She gave us insights about everything, from club politics to improving skills.

                                My first task as a JCC was to welcome the next batch of FFCS members with a ppt explaining every team’s heritage and how things work there. I made the overall PPT and everyone loved it. If you ask any OB / JCC they’ll say that I make the best PPT. These little appreciations are the ones that made me happy and love myself more for who I am. Coming to school trips, I have marked my presence on every school visit and every kid knows me and it was a whole different feeling seeing the innocence of kids and handling them and teaching stuff to them. My other favourite contribution was my expo idea of some game with Jenga blocks which was an absolute blockbuster and organizing Escape Verse which was a blockbuster as well.

But overall VITeach has always been my fav club. Shout out to Dhruv and Abhinay, my fellow teammates for helping me, whenever I had heavy work (Thank you for filling me up when I couldn’t show up), and big thanks to Jafrin for shaping my career in many ways and teaching me many things. She helped me improve my socializing skills, overcome my stage fear. Big Thanks to Jafrin, Dhruv, Abhinay, my friends, and VITeach for all the memories that you gave me.

                                While graduating, I knew that VITeach will always hold a special place in my heart. The experiences and lessons had an impact by shaping my personal and professional growth in ways I never imagined. I am grateful for every moment spent with VITeach and for the lifelong friends I’ve made. The sense of fulfillment and pride in being a VITeacher is something I will carry with me always.

                            I have always wanted to explore all the clubs and chapters in VIT, and right there I came across VITeach. I was moved by the origins of this decade-old club and its rich heritage. As I was going through the pictures, I found memories of my younger self tutoring the kids around my home. Wholeheartedly I applied to join VITeach and got in as a Content Member under Jafrin.
