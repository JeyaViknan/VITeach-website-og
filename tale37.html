                                I have always wanted to explore all the clubs and chapters in VIT, and right there I came across VITeach. I was moved by the origins of this decade-old club and its rich heritage. As I was going through the pictures, I found memories of my younger self tutoring the kids around my home. Wholeheartedly I applied to join VITeach and got in as a Content Member under Jafrin.

                                I still remember my very first task! It was Stationary Drive 1.0. I spent 3-4 hours every day at the event collecting stationery and doing marketing. Meantime I became close with the OBs and other volunteers and felt like they were my kind of people and more, my family. I used to spend a lot of time on the content team and soon got promoted to Content JCC along with Dhruv and Abhinay, and our Lead Jafrin. She was like a mother to us. I might sound dramatic but if you ask Dhruv or Abhinay, they’ll say the same. She gave us insights about everything, from club politics to improving skills.

                                My first task as a JCC was to welcome the next batch of FFCS members with a ppt explaining every team’s heritage and how things work there. I made the overall PPT and everyone loved it. If you ask any OB / JCC they’ll say that I make the best PPT. These little appreciations are the ones that made me happy and love myself more for who I am. Coming to school trips, I have marked my presence on every school visit and every kid knows me and it was a whole different feeling seeing the innocence of kids and handling them and teaching stuff to them. My other favourite contribution was my expo idea of some game with Jenga blocks which was an absolute blockbuster and organizing Escape Verse which was a blockbuster as well.

But overall VITeach has always been my fav club. Shout out to Dhruv and Abhinay, my fellow teammates for helping me, whenever I had heavy work (Thank you for filling me up when I couldn’t show up), and big thanks to Jafrin for shaping my career in many ways and teaching me many things. She helped me improve my socializing skills, overcome my stage fear. Big Thanks to Jafrin, Dhruv, Abhinay, my friends, and VITeach for all the memories that you gave me.

                                While graduating, I knew that VITeach will always hold a special place in my heart. The experiences and lessons had an impact by shaping my personal and professional growth in ways I never imagined. I am grateful for every moment spent with VITeach and for the lifelong friends I’ve made. The sense of fulfillment and pride in being a VITeacher is something I will carry with me always.
