                                <h3>THE BIG CHANGE:</h3>
                                <p>It has been nearly two years since the world we had once known completely changed to accommodate an uninvited and very hostile guest – the coronavirus. Educational institutions across the world were closed, resultantly changing education drastically with the rise of e-learning. Students were out of school and at home, in front of their phones or computers.</p>
                                <p>The school closures due to the pandemic affected at least 1.2 billion students worldwide. Various platforms like Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams and Zoom were adopted as the new digital classroom. Online classes have now become the new norm of learning with institutions opening being halted for the time being.</p>

                                <h3>Adverse Impact of COVID-19 on Students</h3>
                                <p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, students have encountered a multitude of challenges, resulting in a decline in learning outcomes and well-being. Some of these challenges are listed below:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Decline in Learning Outcomes and Well-being:</h4>
                                <p>The big switch to the online mode has had an undeniably large impact on everyone. The lack of physical interaction with their instructors and peers has been one of the biggest challenges faced by students. Several studies have shown that this has increased the risk of student disengagement, and subsequent lower student achievement with adverse effect on physical and mental health.</p>
                                    </li>
                                        
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Integration of Digital Based Learning: Boon or Bane?</h4>
                                <p>The pandemic has also deepened pre- existing inequalities in education. A recent survey suggested that about 56% of students in the country have no access to smartphones or the internet for e-learning. However, the absence of both supervision and peer pressure has resulted in greater individuality & online classes resulted in time efficiency. The availability of resources 24x7 has allowed students to learn at their own pace.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Reduction in Effectiveness</h4>
                                <p>Teachers were not sure how effective their teaching was or how effectively the students were able to understand what was being taught. A few teachers stated the problems they face, like lack of proper teaching facilities like devices, lack of IT support, external disturbance during online classes, lack of data or network issues, etc.</p>
                                    </li>


                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Lack of Attention</h4>
                                <p>Students not paying attention to classes online is one of the biggest challenges that teachers face today. Children are at liberty to mute their mics while attending online classes, and some children also get up and walk away from their device. The primary concern is effectively engaging the students during the classes. The teachers have to learn to hold the attention of their class the best they can.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Progress: Unregulated</h4>
                                <p>During online classes, whenever the teachers tend to ask a question, students easily search the answers online and answer the questions. The teachers cannot pressurize the students to answer by asking them to switch on their videos, so this makes it difficult for the teachers to get to know the actual performance of the students. Students not paying attention during class is the primary cause of this problem.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Irregular Attendances</h4>
                                <p>The students who were not able to go to school did not attend online classes regularly. The teachers understand the problems, but it becomes really difficult for them to know why the student isn't regular. To maintain regularity of each and every student in the class is quite difficult.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Students out of Reach</h4>
                                <p>When it comes to the students who do not have access to the basic facilities such as smartphones, laptops, tabs or stable internet connection, the teachers face quite a lot of difficulties. The teacher cannot connect or stay in contact with the student and has to excuse the student many times on these grounds.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Impractical – Practical Learning</h4>
                                <p>Knowledge is of no use unless you put it into practice. No practice leads to a lack of perfection, this, in turn, affects the value of education.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Distractions & Unstability</h4>
                                <p>The most common challenge of online education is distractions by social media. Many students scroll through social media during classes. Non-verbal communication makes some students hear, but not listen.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>"Network not connected" & More</h4>
                                <p>Poor network connectivity is very common in online education. This can affect the flow of students' learning as the individual has forced distractions and unscheduled breaks.</p>
                                    </li>


                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Infrastructural Problems</h4>
                                <p>Few students do not have the necessary facilities and resources to learn effectively as compared to those provided on the campus. Libraries, Labs, etc. are a few facilities necessary for fruitful learning.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Lack of In-Person Interaction</h4>
                                <p>In-person interaction helps the students learn and socialize effectively.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Children</h4>
                                <p>According to studies, due to adverse effects of the pandemic and lockdown, youngsters feel insecure, afraid, and alone leading to disturbed sleep, nightmares, poor eating, irritability, inattention, and separation anxiety.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>The Youth & the Effect of COVID</h4>
                                <p>Children and adolescents who are confined to their homes developed uncertainty and anxiety as a result of disruptions in their schooling, physical activity, and socializing chances.</p>
                                    </li>


                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Impact of COVID-19 on Productivity</h4>
                                <p>The shift to online hybrid learning has seemed to be only effective if students have consistent access to the internet and computers. The absence of a structured educational setting for an extended period of time causes disruption in routine, boredom, and a lack of inventive ideas for participating in various academic and extracurricular activities.</p>
                                <p>Students have faced numerous issues like the lack of productivity when taking online classes, lack of motivation, lack of understanding of the material, a decrease in communication between students and instructors, and a sense of isolation caused by online classes.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Positive Impact of COVID-19 on Students</h3>
                                <p>Despite the many adversities posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it has also spurred unexpected positive outcomes for students. This unprecedented global event has catalyzed shifts in education and personal growth, presenting unique opportunities amidst the challenges. From innovative learning approaches to newfound resilience, students have navigated these turbulent times with adaptability and determination. In this discourse, we explore the silver linings amidst the adversity, highlighting the positive impact of COVID-19 on students.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Quality Time with Family!</h4>
                                <p>Before the pandemic, many people were busy like, juggling school, work, family, and more. It was hard to slow down and spend time with our families. With schools closed and most people working from home, has brought families closer than ever. That extra time for real connections is priceless and crucial to mental health.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>WFH: Not Exactly a Bane?</h4>
                                <p>With shutdowns and stay-at-home calls, many businesses, institutions, and organisations have transitioned to 100% remote work and teaching. With employees and students able to work from home, less time is spent on travel, more time is available for personal needs, and working hours become more flexible, allowing many to achieve a better work-life balance.</p>

                                        <h4>Improvement in Sleep Cycles</h4>
                                <p>Healthy sleep is important to boost our immunity and fight stress. Sleep used to be the last thing we focused on in our efforts to fulfill other priorities in life. Getting up early and rushing to the office and to the university has become an integral part of our everyday lives. With people staying and being bound to work from home, they can now get enough sleep.</p>

                                <p>Longer stays at home, the better sleep schedules, and a good work-life balance allows many to combat this stress by prioritizing physical and mental health.

                                <h3>THE BIG CHANGE:</h3>
                                <p>It has been nearly two years since the world we had once known completely changed to accommodate an uninvited and very hostile guest – the coronavirus. Educational institutions across the world were closed, resultantly changing education drastically with the rise of e-learning. Students were out of school and at home, in front of their phones or computers.</p>
                                <p>The school closures due to the pandemic affected at least 1.2 billion students worldwide. Various platforms like Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams and Zoom were adopted as the new digital classroom. Online classes have now become the new norm of learning with institutions opening being halted for the time being.</p>

                                <h3>Adverse Impact of COVID-19 on Students</h3>
                                <p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, students have encountered a multitude of challenges, resulting in a decline in learning outcomes and well-being. Some of these challenges are listed below:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Decline in Learning Outcomes and Well-being:</h4>
                                <p>The big switch to the online mode has had an undeniably large impact on everyone. The lack of physical interaction with their instructors and peers has been one of the biggest challenges faced by students. Several studies have shown that this has increased the risk of student disengagement, and subsequent lower student achievement with adverse effect on physical and mental health.</p>
                                    </li>
                                        
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Integration of Digital Based Learning: Boon or Bane?</h4>
                                <p>The pandemic has also deepened pre- existing inequalities in education. A recent survey suggested that about 56% of students in the country have no access to smartphones or the internet for e-learning. However, the absence of both supervision and peer pressure has resulted in greater individuality & online classes resulted in time efficiency. The availability of resources 24x7 has allowed students to learn at their own pace.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Reduction in Effectiveness</h4>
                                <p>Teachers were not sure how effective their teaching was or how effectively the students were able to understand what was being taught. A few teachers stated the problems they face, like lack of proper teaching facilities like devices, lack of IT support, external disturbance during online classes, lack of data or network issues, etc.</p>
                                    </li>


                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Lack of Attention</h4>
                                <p>Students not paying attention to classes online is one of the biggest challenges that teachers face today. Children are at liberty to mute their mics while attending online classes, and some children also get up and walk away from their device. The primary concern is effectively engaging the students during the classes. The teachers have to learn to hold the attention of their class the best they can.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Progress: Unregulated</h4>
                                <p>During online classes, whenever the teachers tend to ask a question, students easily search the answers online and answer the questions. The teachers cannot pressurize the students to answer by asking them to switch on their videos, so this makes it difficult for the teachers to get to know the actual performance of the students. Students not paying attention during class is the primary cause of this problem.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Irregular Attendances</h4>
                                <p>The students who were not able to go to school did not attend online classes regularly. The teachers understand the problems, but it becomes really difficult for them to know why the student isn't regular. To maintain regularity of each and every student in the class is quite difficult.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Students out of Reach</h4>
                                <p>When it comes to the students who do not have access to the basic facilities such as smartphones, laptops, tabs or stable internet connection, the teachers face quite a lot of difficulties. The teacher cannot connect or stay in contact with the student and has to excuse the student many times on these grounds.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Impractical – Practical Learning</h4>
                                <p>Knowledge is of no use unless you put it into practice. No practice leads to a lack of perfection, this, in turn, affects the value of education.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Distractions & Unstability</h4>
                                <p>The most common challenge of online education is distractions by social media. Many students scroll through social media during classes. Non-verbal communication makes some students hear, but not listen.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>"Network not connected" & More</h4>
                                <p>Poor network connectivity is very common in online education. This can affect the flow of students' learning as the individual has forced distractions and unscheduled breaks.</p>
                                    </li>


                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Infrastructural Problems</h4>
                                <p>Few students do not have the necessary facilities and resources to learn effectively as compared to those provided on the campus. Libraries, Labs, etc. are a few facilities necessary for fruitful learning.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Lack of In-Person Interaction</h4>
                                <p>In-person interaction helps the students learn and socialize effectively.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Children</h4>
                                <p>According to studies, due to adverse effects of the pandemic and lockdown, youngsters feel insecure, afraid, and alone leading to disturbed sleep, nightmares, poor eating, irritability, inattention, and separation anxiety.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>The Youth & the Effect of COVID</h4>
                                <p>Children and adolescents who are confined to their homes developed uncertainty and anxiety as a result of disruptions in their schooling, physical activity, and socializing chances.</p>
                                    </li>


                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Impact of COVID-19 on Productivity</h4>
                                <p>The shift to online hybrid learning has seemed to be only effective if students have consistent access to the internet and computers. The absence of a structured educational setting for an extended period of time causes disruption in routine, boredom, and a lack of inventive ideas for participating in various academic and extracurricular activities.</p>
                                <p>Students have faced numerous issues like the lack of productivity when taking online classes, lack of motivation, lack of understanding of the material, a decrease in communication between students and instructors, and a sense of isolation caused by online classes.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Positive Impact of COVID-19 on Students</h3>
                                <p>Despite the many adversities posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it has also spurred unexpected positive outcomes for students. This unprecedented global event has catalyzed shifts in education and personal growth, presenting unique opportunities amidst the challenges. From innovative learning approaches to newfound resilience, students have navigated these turbulent times with adaptability and determination. In this discourse, we explore the silver linings amidst the adversity, highlighting the positive impact of COVID-19 on students.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Quality Time with Family!</h4>
                                <p>Before the pandemic, many people were busy like, juggling school, work, family, and more. It was hard to slow down and spend time with our families. With schools closed and most people working from home, has brought families closer than ever. That extra time for real connections is priceless and crucial to mental health.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>WFH: Not Exactly a Bane?</h4>
                                <p>With shutdowns and stay-at-home calls, many businesses, institutions, and organisations have transitioned to 100% remote work and teaching. With employees and students able to work from home, less time is spent on travel, more time is available for personal needs, and working hours become more flexible, allowing many to achieve a better work-life balance.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Improvement in Sleep Cycles</h4>
                                <p>Healthy sleep is important to boost our immunity and fight stress. Sleep used to be the last thing we focused on in our efforts to fulfill other priorities in life. Getting up early and rushing to the office and to the university has become an integral part of our everyday lives. With people staying and being bound to work from home, they can now get enough sleep.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Put Yourself First</h4>
                                <p>Longer stays at home, the better sleep schedules, and a good work-life balance allows many to combat this stress by prioritizing physical and mental health. With healthcare resources readily available, including telemedicine video visits, it's easier to make self-care a priority.</p>
                                    </li>
